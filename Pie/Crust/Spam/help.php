				<h2>FAQs</h2>
				<h4>Why is my Faker Score not updating?</h4>
				<p>We cache our scores for up to 24 hours so that we don't over burden the Twitter API. Please be patient they will update by tomorrow.</p>
				<h4>Why am I seeing a Twitter API limit error?</h4>
				<p>Twitter impose very stringent API limits. These are reset every 15 minutes so just wait a little while and try again.</p>
				<h4>How do I get more searches?</h4>
				<p>To get unlimited searches please purchase a <a href="/Payments/Subscriptions">Basic Subscription</a>. It's very cheap.</p>

				<p>Auto Block will remove all your Fake Followers. Existing ones and those that appear in the future.</p>
				<h4>How long does Auto Block take to get rid of all my Fake Followers?</h4>
				<p>This depends on how many you have. If it is in the 1,000s it can take a few days. We block about 1,000-2,000 per day.</p>
				<h4>I don't want my subscription to auto renew</h4>
				<p>None of our subscriptions auto renew. You have to purchase a new one manually. So do not worry.</p>
